# Image-Classification

Codes are available for Image classification Problems.                                                                                          

CAT vs DOG Classifier classifies cat and dog images  using ImageDataGenerator Transfer Learning (InceptionV3 model) in Keras to get ~94% accuracy.

Multi Label Classification contains 3 codes. First one is for building an Animal Classifier to classify in 3 different classses which are cat,dog and horse. Second One is for building a Nature Image Classification whichh classifies Nature Images into multiple categories such as desert,sea,mountain,etc. Third One is the Solution for Intel Image Classification problem from KAGGLE.
